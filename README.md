Kevin Moskowitz,[2] better known as The Deep, is a member of the Seven and a major antagonist in the Amazon series The Boys, serving as a major antagonist in both Season 1 and 4 and a supporting antagonist in both Season 2 and Season 3.

He is an aquatic superhero with the ability to breath underwater and communicate with sea animals, but powers (when not near any kind of body of water) are actually comically useless.

After defecting from the Church of the Collective, The Deep has become a favorite on the national talk show circuit with the success of his (ghost-written) memoir, Deeper, about his escape from the cult and with his brilliant wife, Cassandra, coaching him along, heâ€™s finally getting the recognition he thinks he deserves. But none of that compares to being a hero in The Seven and he wants back in; really bad.

Upon rejoining The Seven, The Deep faithfully followed Homelander's orders due to his threats. While trying to repair his life, he had conflicts with Cassandra, and had a sexual encounter with an octopus. While supporting Homelander and his quest to take control of the planet, The Deep formed a sexual relationship with new member of The Seven, Sister Sage, and formed a close friendship with Black Noir II.
